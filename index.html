    <!-- <p> Since being a kid I've been facinated with codes and ciphers. While computer encryption is great, there is something I always found magical about ciphers you can do with nothing more than a piece of paper. However, sometimes just because you can do them by hand doesn't mean you always need to, just like you don't pull out paper to multiply two large numbers.  You would rather use a calculator. This is the calculator for hand ciphers.  </p> -->
